## My process

Stared with HTML. Then moved onto the styling, insuring I had setup the font style. 
Moved into getting the flexbox to work correctly. 
More focused styling of each html element e.g. the hover for the buttons. 
Finally added the screen breakpoints to insure it worked on all devices. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
